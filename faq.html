      <h2>DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com - FAQ</h2>
      <p class="bold">What is this?</p>
      <p><span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> is a joke tool that can be used to artificially increase the number of blocked ads in your ad blocker's blocked ad counter.</p>

      <p class="bold">What does this do?</p>
      <p><span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> uses JavaScript run locally in your browser to perform a GET request to <span class="italic">ads.driveyouradblockcounterup.com</span> once every 50 milliseconds. <span class="italic">ads.driveyouradblockcounterup.com</span> is not a real ad server (it just runs a Cloudflare Worker that responds with a bit of static JSON) but most ad blockers will assume that it's used to serve ads and will block it - repeatedly.</p>

      <p class="bold">Will this work with every ad blocker?</p>
      <p>Not necesscerily. Most browser-extension-based ad blockers will block the <span class="italic">ads.*</span> domain pattern, but this is not necesscerily true in all cases. <span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> may not work for purely DNS-level ad blocking solutions (like Pi-hole or solutions that use your hosts file).</p>

      <p class="bold">It's saying that it can't detect an ad blocker, but I have an ad blocker. Why is this?</p>
      <p>Your ad blocker probably doesn't block the <span class="italic">ads.*</span> domain pattern. I personally recommend you try <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" rel="noopener noreferrer"> uBlock Origin</a> instead if you're having this issue.</p>

      <p class="bold">What happens if I run this without an ad blocker?</p>
      <p><span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> performs a GET request to <span class="italic">ads.driveyouradblockcounterup.com</span> once every 50 milliseconds. The expectation is that these requests will not be successful (because they will be blocked by an ad blocker). If any request is sucessful, <span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> will display an error stating that it couldn't detect an ad blocker and it will stop. This is to protect your and our network environments from excessive traffic.</p>

      <p class="bold">Is this dangerous or malicious?</p>
      <p>No - at least not as I write this. If you're worried, the source code to this website is available <a href="https://github.com/aghorler/DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p class="bold">Does this website try to serve actual ads?</p>
      <p>No. <span class="italic">DriveYourAdBlockCounterUp.com</span> performs a repeated request to a fake ad server on a subdomain of this domain. No genuine ads are attempted or loaded.</p>

      <p class="bold">Is this a legimate tool?</p>
      <p>No. This is a joke and it has no legitimate use.</p>
